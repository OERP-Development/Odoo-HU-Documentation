.. |SO| replace:: :abbr:`SO (Sales Order)`

A *package* is a physical container holding one or more products during a picking. They can also be
used to store items in bulk.

Packages are commonly used for the following purposes:

#. :ref:`Relocate products from stock <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-use>` to packing or
   outbound area for delivery.
#. :ref:`Shipping to customers <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`: configure package types
   to align with shipping carriers' size and weight requirements, streamlining the packing process
   and ensuring compliance with carrier shipping specifications.
#. Store items in bulk.

Refer to the table below for essential package configurations based on different use cases. Skip to
the corresponding sections by selecting the blue link to configure the necessary features for the
intended package usage.

*Package use* is a field on the package form in Odoo that is only visible by enabling the
:guilabel:`Batch Transfers` feature in settings. The default package type is :guilabel:`Disposable`,
so this feature is only required when packages are intended to be used for batch transfers and other
internal warehouse moves.

*Package type* is an optional feature to create packages with defined dimensions and weight limits.
This feature is mainly to set templates and ensure packages to comply with the shipping requirements
of third-party carriers.

.. note::
   While packages are commonly used in the :doc:`three step delivery route
   <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>`, they can be used in any
   workflow involving storable products.

Configuration
=============

To use packages, first go to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`. Under
the :guilabel:`Operations` heading, activate the :guilabel:`Packages` feature. Then, click
:guilabel:`Save`.

Package use
===========

.. note::
   The following section is necessary only when packages are intended to be used for batch
   transfers.

.. seealso::
   - :doc:`Picking method: batch <batch_transfers>`
   - :doc:`Picking method: cluster <cluster_picking>`
   - :doc:`Picking method: wave <wave_transfers>`

First, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings` and activate the
:guilabel:`Batch Transfers` feature, located in the :guilabel:`Operations` section. Doing so makes
the :guilabel:`Package Use` field become visible on a package form.

.. image:: package/enable-batch.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Activate the *Batch Transfers* feature in Inventory > Configuration > Settings.

Then, go to the package form to configure the package intended for batch picking. To do that,
navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Products --> Packages`.

On this page, add new packages by clicking :guilabel:`New` or select an existing package. Doing so
opens the package form, which contains the following fields:

- :guilabel:`Package Reference`: (required) name of the package
- :guilabel:`Pack Date`: the date that the package was created
- :guilabel:`Package Use`: choose :guilabel:`Reusable` for packages meant to be used for moving
  products within the warehouse; :guilabel:`Disposable` for packages to contain products to ship to
  customers.
- :guilabel:`Package Type`: this field is mostly used for :ref:`configuring shipping boxes to ship
  to the customer <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-type>`.

  .. note::
     :guilabel:`Package Type` is unnecessary for configuring batch transfer packages.

- :guilabel:`Shipping Weight`: field for the user to input the weight of the package after measuring
  it on a scale.
- :guilabel:`Company`: specify a company to make the package available **only** at the selected
  company. Leave the field blank if the package is available at all companies.

Add to batch
------------

.. important::
   The following example uses packages in a :doc:`three-step delivery
   <../../shipping_receiving/daily_operations/delivery_three_steps>` workflow.

   This workflow requires the :guilabel:`Packages`, :guilabel:`Storage Locations`, and
   :guilabel:`Multi-Step Routes` features to be enabled in :menuselection:`Inventory app -->
   Configuration --> Settings`. On the warehouse configuration page (:menuselection:`Inventory app
   --> Configuration --> Warehouses`), the :guilabel:`Outgoing Shipments` option is set to
   :guilabel:`Pack goods, send goods in output and then deliver (3 steps)`.

After confirming a sales order, selecting the :guilabel:`Delivery` smart button displays the three
tasks to complete the delivery.

   :alt: Clicking "Delivery" smart button displays the pick, pack, ship steps.

To create a batch transfer, navigate to :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Operations --> Internal`
and select the check boxes next to the pick operations that are to be added to the batch.

After the pick operations are selected, navigate to the :guilabel:`⚙️ Actions` button and select
:guilabel:`Add to batch` from the list of drop-down options.

.. image:: package/create-batch.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Add pickings to batch.

Doing so opens an :guilabel:`Add to batch` pop-up window, and click :guilabel:`Confirm` to finish
creating the batch.

   :ref:`More info about the fields in the 'Add to batch' window
   <inventory/warehouses_storage/add-batch-transfers>`

Pack items
----------

After creating the batch, open the batch transfer and select a reusable package (created in the
:ref:`previous step <inventory/warehouses_storage/package-use>`) in the :guilabel:`Destination
Package` field to place items in the package.

.. example::
   The reusable package, `CLUSTER-PACK-1` is assigned to the :guilabel:`Destination Package` field
   of all items in the batch transfer, `BATCH/00003`.

  .. image:: package/assign-package.png
     :align: center
     :alt: Assign pickings to a package through the "Destination Package" field.

Alternatively, click the :guilabel:`Put in Pack` button to create a new package and place all the
items in the batch in that newly created package.

.. note::
   Ensure the new package's :guilabel:`Package Use` field is set to :guilabel:`Reusable` by clicking
   the package's :guilabel:`➡️ (right arrow)` icon to open the package form.

      :alt: Show internal link

.. example::

   Clicking :guilabel:`Put in Pack` creates a new package, `PACK0000002`, and assigns all items to
   it in the :guilabel:`Destination Package` field.

Package type
============

Create package types at :menuselection:`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Package Types` to set
custom dimensions and weight limits. This feature is mainly to set templates and ensure packages to
comply with the shipping requirements of third-party carriers.

.. seealso::
   :doc:`Shipping carriers <../../shipping_receiving/setup_configuration/third_party_shipper>`

On the :guilabel:`Package Types` list, clicking :guilabel:`New` opens a blank package type form. The
following fields of the form are as follows:

- :guilabel:`Package Type` (required): define the package type's name.
- :guilabel:`Size`: define the dimensions of the package in millimeters (mm). The fields from left
  to right define the :guilabel:`Length`, :guilabel:`Width`, and :guilabel:`Height`.
- :guilabel:`Weight`: record the theoretical weight of the package type. This value is a placeholder
  for when the weight of the contained products is not available.
- :guilabel:`Max Weight`: maximum shipping weight allowed in the package.
- :guilabel:`Barcode`: define a barcode to identify the package type from a scan.
- :guilabel:`Company`: specify a company to make the package type available **only** at the selected
  company. Leave the field blank if it is available at all companies.
- :guilabel:`Carrier`: specifies the intended shipping carrier for this package type.
- :guilabel:`Carrier Code`: define a code that is linked to the package type.
